  "description": "A high-level, component-based, interaction system for creating VR and AR experiences. It provides a framework that makes 3D and UI interactions available from Unity input events. The core of this system is a set of base Interactor and Interactable components, and an Interaction Manager that ties these two types of components together. It also contains components that you can use for locomotion and drawing visuals.",

    "changelog": "### Changed\n- Changed XRI project validation to only log errors to the console, not warnings.\n- Updated `XRPokeFollowAffordance` smoothing property default from 8 to 16 to make it feel more responsive.\n\n### Fixed\n- Added additional checks against AR Foundation 5.0 and newer so deprecation messages and the use of the newer XR Origin (AR) is hidden when using AR Foundation 4.2 and older.\n- Fixed GC allocations produced each frame by `XRPokeInteractor.UpdateUIModel`.\n- Fixed frame-timing for Locomotion Input Tests when running in batch mode.\n- `XRInteractableAffordanceStateProvider` Fixes:\n    - Activated state was lower priority than selected, which because select is not exited, this was causing issues with it not appearing.\n    - There were some racing coroutines between select and activate, and now trigger a new animation blocks previous animations\n    - Leaving the select state cancels select animations that might not have completed\n    - Leaving activated state cancels activate animations that might not have completed\n- Fixed repeat audio issue in the `AudioAffordanceReceiver` by adding extra conditions which treat select as a modifier to hover, and activated as a modifier to select. Doing this prevents triggering repeat audio clips that shouldn't fire, like releasing the activate trigger, or releasing the select trigger while still hovering.\n- Fixed `XRPokeLogic` issue where poking from behind objects would sometimes trigger select incorrectly.\n- Fixed `XRPokeLogic` issue where depth percent was incorrectly calculated using an exponential value which would result in poke buttons feeling disconnected from the poke interactor position."
