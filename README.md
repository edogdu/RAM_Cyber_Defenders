## CyberGuard: Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality Cybersecurity Card Game

Welcome to the Cyber Threat Guardian (CTG) VR project repository. This project is a part of the CS-4091 Research Class, aimed at exploring new ways to teach cybersecurity to children. In this adaptation, we've transformed the Cyber Threat Guardian (CTG) physical card game into a virtual reality (VR) experience, allowing kids to immerse themselves in a cyber environment while introducing them to new cybersecurity concepts.

## Project Overview

A cutting-edge cybersecurity card game using virtual reality (VR) technologies will be developed. Players will immerse themselves in a virtual world where they learn essential cybersecurity information and defense strategies using a deck of cybersecurity-themed cards. The game will be developed using Unity, the leading game development engine, and will leverage VR technologies to provide an immersive and engaging gaming experience. As for equipment, multiple Oculus Quest 2 devices will be provided for hands-on development and testing.

## Features

- **Immersive VR Environment:** Virtual Reality (VR) integration to enhance the overall gaming experience.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Engage in interactive gameplay mechanics tailored to teach important cybersecurity concepts, such as understanding attack, defense, and Assets.
- **Educational Content:** Gameplay with a focus on real-world cybersecurity scenarios.
- **Single Player Gameplay:** AI opponent for fun and competitive gameplay.
- **Multiplayer Gameplay:** In progress...
- **VR Control Support:** User-friendly interface and intuitive controls for VR platforms.
- **Open Source Project:** Source code and assets organized in a version-controlled repository.

## Rules

There are two primary objectives to consider when playing: (1) protect each asset with a defense card and (2) become the winner by obtaining the most asset and defense cards at the end of the game.

## Getting Started

To experience CTG VR, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/edogdu/RAM_Cyber_Defenders.git`.
